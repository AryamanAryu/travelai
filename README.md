###  💼 Project: **BharatBrahma – AI-Powered India Travel Itinerary Planner**

**Overview:**
BharatBrahma is a full-stack web application I’m building that leverages AI to create **personalized travel itineraries** for Indian destinations. It takes user preferences like travel duration, interests (history, food, nature, etc.), and budget to generate detailed, day-wise travel plans tailored to the unique diversity of India.

**Purpose:**
India’s rich cultural and geographic diversity makes trip planning complex. BharatBrahma aims to simplify this with **LLM-powered trip generation**, offering personalized, well-structured, and locally relevant plans.
